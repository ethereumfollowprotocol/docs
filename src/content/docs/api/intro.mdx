EFP provides an open source indexer and API for indexing and retrieving EFP data.

### Public API

EFP core team provides a public API endpoint at [`https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1`](https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1).

If you are a developer, you are free to use this endpoint to retrieve EFP data.

### Commonly used endpoints

- [User Stats](https://docs.efp.app/api/users/stats/): the follower and following counts of a particular user
- [User Following](https://docs.efp.app/api/users/following/): list of the accounts a particular user follows
- [User Followers](https://docs.efp.app/api/users/followers/): list of the accounts that follow a particular user
- [User ENS data](https://docs.efp.app/api/users/ens/): the ENS data for a particular user

### Self-hosting

You may also fork EFP's Indexer/API source code and deploy yourself.

### KV cache

The API uses Cloudflare KV storage to cache some endpoint's responses. When one of these endpoints is called the cache is checked and if there is no record the data is fetched from the database. If a cached record is found it is returned immediately. All cache records are set to expire 5 minutes after they are created.

The cached record for each of these endpoints can be refreshed by adding `cache=fresh` to the query params. For example:

Get the cached record

```sh
curl https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1/lists/1/details
```

Get latest data and reset the cached record

```sh
curl https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1/lists/1/details?cache=fresh
```
