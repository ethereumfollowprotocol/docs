title: Running EFP
---

### EFP Silo

The backend architecture for EFP is comprised of the following components

- [Database](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) (Postgres)
- [PGBouncer](https://hub.docker.com/r/pgbouncer/pgbouncer) (a connection pooler for Postgres)
- [Indexers](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/indexer) for Base, Optimism and Ethereum Mainnet
- [Service Manager](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/services) (updates ens data, leaderboard, cache, mutuals counts)
- [API](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/api) (Can be deployed as a cloudflare worker)
- [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) Cache for the API

All of these components can be set up separately, whether locally or using external hosts.  The quickest way to stand up all of the backend infrastructure is to use the 'EFP-Silo' template on [Railway](https://railway.app)

### Railway Template

Deploying the EFP-Silo template on Railway will set up all of the aforementioned components with default parameters set. 

[EFP-Silo](https://railway.app/template/pDGEZm?referralCode=AavWEU) Click the link or the button below.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/pDGEZm?referralCode=AavWEU)

#### Configuration

The template will run with default values for most of the components but you will need to set primary and secondary rpc urls for all three chains that EFP is using (Base, Optimism and Ethereum Mainnet).  Find the section for 'Indexer-8453', click the 'configure' button and set the rpc endpoint for all six fields accordingly. These can be Alchemy or Infura urls or local ethereum nodes if you're testing at home.

Once all sections display 'Ready to be deployed' the 'Deploy' button at the bottom will be unlocked and you can click it to proceed.

#### Setup API URL
Enable public networking for the API by clicking on the API section, then the 'Settings' tab and scrolling down to 'Networking'.  Click 'Generate Domain' to have Railway create a random public link for you.  Or click 'Custom Domain' to use an already existing domain name.

#### Syncing
It will take a few hours to sync all EFP data, you can still call the api but the data will not be up to date.

#### Service Manager
The services module handles several jobs that run on intervals:
- Building the list of all addresses in the EFP database
- Building the Leaderboard Ranking
- Tracking Mutual follows
- Shuffling the recommended accounts list 
- Refreshing ENS metadata
- Building a list of accounts with recent activity

The intervals for running these jobs can be adjusted to suit your needs.  Additionally the accounts that appear in the recommended follows can be customized by forking the services repo and editing '/src/services/recommended/lists.ts'.  Once you've edited the file, go to the 'Settings' tab on the services module and update the 'Source Repo' to point to your forked github repository.

#### ENV variables
Most of the Environment variables are set appropriately and should not be changed unless you know exactly what you're doing.  However there are a few settings than can be customized to fit your needs.  As a general rule, if they're not listed below then you probably should leave them as is.
