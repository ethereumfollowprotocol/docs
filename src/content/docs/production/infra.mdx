![EFP Backend Design](/backend-design.png)

The backend architecture for EFP is comprised of the following components

- [Database](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) (Postgres)
- [PGBouncer](https://hub.docker.com/r/pgbouncer/pgbouncer) (a connection pooler for Postgres)
- [EFP Indexers](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/indexer) for Base, Optimism and Ethereum Mainnet
- [EFP Services](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/services) (updates ens data, leaderboard, cache, mutuals counts)
- [EFP API](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/api) (Can be deployed as a cloudflare worker)
- [Ens Worker](https://github.com/v3xlabs/enstate) (Can be deployed as a cloudflare worker)
- [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) Cache for the API and ENS Worker

All of these components can be set up separately, whether locally or using external hosts.  The quickest way to stand up all of the backend infrastructure is to use the [EFP-Silo Railway template](https://railway.app/template/pDGEZm?referralCode=AavWEU)

### Indexers

EFP has Registry and AccountMetadata contracts deployed on Base and ListRecords contracts deployed on three chains: Base, Optimism And Ethereum Mainnet. To capture and store all EFP data we run three separate instances of our indexer service, one for each chain.

### Database

EFP Data is stored in a Postgres Database, queries and schema can be found in the [EFP Indexer Repo](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/indexer/tree/develop/db)

### Connection Pooling

PgBouncer is used to handle connection pooling for the database.  This improves availability for the database over the api by sharing client connections, saving overhead on connection/reconnection.

### Data Services

The services module handles several jobs that run on intervals:
- Building the list of all addresses in the EFP database
- Building the Leaderboard Ranking
- Tracking Mutual follows
- Shuffling the recommended accounts list 
- Refreshing ENS metadata
- Building a list of accounts with recent activity

The intervals for running these jobs can be adjusted to suit your needs.  Additionally the accounts that appear in the recommended follows can be customized by forking the services repo and editing '/src/services/recommended/lists.ts'.  Once you've edited the file, go to the 'Settings' tab on the services module and update the 'Source Repo' to point to your forked github repository.

### API
EFP core team provides a public API endpoint at [`https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1`](https://api.ethfollow.xyz/api/v1).

If you are a developer, you are free to use this endpoint to retrieve EFP data.

#### Commonly used endpoints

- [User Stats](https://docs.ethfollow.xyz/api/users/stats/): the follower and following counts of a particular user
- [User Following](https://docs.ethfollow.xyz/api/users/following/): list of the accounts a particular user follows
- [User Followers](https://docs.ethfollow.xyz/api/users/followers/): list of the accounts that follow a particular user
- [User ENS data](https://docs.ethfollow.xyz/api/users/ens/): the ENS data for a particular user

### ENS Worker
The API uses V3X Labs' [enstate](https://github.com/v3xlabs/enstate) to provide ENS data.  This service is available at https://ens.ethfollow.xyz. EFP is happy to provide use of this endpoint to the community but please do not abuse it.  

Anyone can deploy this ENS worker repository to cloudflare or host their own instance locally. Read more about deploying [here](https://github.com/v3xlabs/enstate?tab=readme-ov-file#-cloudflare-workers).  

### Redis Cache
The Redis cache is used by both the API and the ENS Worker to cache responses for faster future retrieval.
