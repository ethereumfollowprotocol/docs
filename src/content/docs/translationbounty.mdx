title: Translation Bounty
---

EFP is for everyone, and that includes translating the app to make it more easily accessible to a wider range of users. Please consider using your expertise to help us do that!

*Before submitting a translation, please read this entire page carefully.*

## Rewards

Those who either submit a full translation or make a significant contribution to one may earn:
- Up to **$200** (paid in Ethereum L1 USDC)
- A special **EFP Translator POAP**

Whether a submitter earns one, both, or part the above rewards is determined at our discretion, based on the quality of the submission and extent of their contribution.

If you earn a reward, we'll send it to you soon after your translation has been merged to our app.

## Qualifying Languages

Just about any language! We of course want **languages with a large number of speakers**, but we also want **ones with a small number**. We're even open to **dead languages** (e.g. Latin) and **fictional languages** (e.g. Klingon, Quenya, etc).

If it's a real language (you can't make up your own), we're open.

## How to Submit or Contribute

**Before submitting a full translation for a new language, check to see if we already have a translation for it.** You can check the language selector menu in the app or the [translations folder on Github](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/app/tree/main/public/locales), and you may want to check [pull requests](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/app/pulls) to see if one is pending approval.

**Only submit or contribute to translations for languages of which you are a native speaker** (or, in the case of dead or fictional languages, a fluent speaker). Don't use ChatGPT, Google Translate, or similar services. EFP uses niche, technical language, so **we need crypto-natives who can give us the correct translations**.

You can use one of two methods for submitting a translation:

### 1) Github

Make a copy of [this folder](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/app/tree/main/public/locales/en) which contains the English translation, translate all the words and phrases on the right side of the ":" in each line from English to the new language, and submit your translation as a pull request.

Be sure to include your ENS name (for Ethereum USDC) and an email address (for POAP claim link) in your pull request so that, if accepted, we can send you your rewards.

### 2) Email

If you don't know how to use Github, go to [this page](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/app/blob/main/public/locales/en/translations.json), copy and paste the text into an email, translate all the words and phrases on the right side of the ":" in each line from English to the new language, and email the translation to us at [translations@ethfollow.xyz](mailto:translations@ethfollow.xyz).

Be sure to include your ENS name (for Ethereum USDC) and an email address (for POAP claim link) in your pull request so that, if accepted, we can send you your rewards.

## Corrections

If you are a native speaker of a language and see an improper translation, you may submit a correction by the above mentioned methods. Your potential reward will be proportionate to your contribution.

## Ongoing expansions to translations

As we add new features to the app, we will add new text in English. If a translation doesn't exist for a particular word or phrase, the app will fallback to the English translation. So **if you see English when using another language in the app, it's likely the language's translation file needs a translation added for that word or phrase**.

If you are a native speaker of a language and see a missing translation, you may submit an update by the above mentioned methods. Your potential reward will be proportionate to your contribution.
