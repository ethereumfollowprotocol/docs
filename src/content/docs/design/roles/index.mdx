title: Roles
---

Every EFP List has three roles, each of which are held by an Ethereum account, either an EOA or contract address.

1. **Owner:**
   - Is the owner of the EFP List NFT
   - Can transfer ownership of the EFP List NFT
   - Can edit the List Storage Location
2. **Manager:**
   - Is the manager of the EFP list records and metadata
   - Can transfer the Manager role to another address
   - Can set or update the user
   - Can add/remove list records and add/remove tags
   - Can add metadata key/value to the list
3. **User:**
   - The Ethereum address for whom the list is intended; the Ethereum account that is following the Ethereum accounts in the list.

Typically, all three roles (Owner, Manager, User) are the same Ethereum account, but they can be different.
