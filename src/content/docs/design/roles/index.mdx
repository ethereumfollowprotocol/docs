title: Roles
---

Every EFP List NFT has two roles, each of which are held by an Ethereum account, either an EOA or contract address.

1. **Owner:**
   - Is the owner of the EFP List NFT
   - Can transfer the Owner role
   - Can edit the User role
   - Can edit the List Records Storage Location
2. **User:**
   - The Ethereum address for whom the list is intended; the Ethereum account that is following the Ethereum accounts in the list.

Typically, both roles (Owner, User) are the same Ethereum account, but they can be different.
