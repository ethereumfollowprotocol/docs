title: List Metadata
---

Every EFP List has associated key-value metadata called **List Metadata**.

List Metadata is stored onchain alongside List Records in the same contract, but in a different format (key-value pairs).

Data is stored with a `string` key and `bytes` value, for each EFP List.

Only the Manager of the EFP List can set or update the metadata for a list.

This allows Managers to store list-specific configuration or preference data.

## Global keys

Global Keys must be made up of lowercase letters, numbers and the hyphen (-) character.

There are currently two global keys defined for List Metadata:

| Key       | Description                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manager` | The Ethereum address of the Manager role associated with the EFP List, which is able to edit List Records.|
| `user`    | The Ethereum address of the User role associated with the EFP List, which is the Ethereum account that is following the Ethereum accounts in the list.|

### "manager"

The `manager` key is used to store the Manager role associated with an EFP List.

The manager is represented as a 20-byte address.

| Byte(s) | Description        | Value                                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0-19    | Address (20 bytes) | 0x00000000000000000000000000000000DeaDBeef |

#### Code

```solidity
// set the manager for the EFP list
efpListMetadata.setValue(tokenId, "manager", abi.encodePacked(manager));
```

By reading the `manager` key for a given List, a client can determine the Manager associated with that list.

```solidity
address manager = abi.decode(efpListMetadata.getValue(tokenId, "manager"), (address));
```

### "user"

The `user` key is used to store the User role associated with an EFP List.

The user is represented as a 20-byte address.

| Byte(s) | Description        | Value                                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0-19    | Address (20 bytes) | 0x00000000000000000000000000000000DeaDBeef |

#### Code

with example code shown below:

```solidity
// set the user for the EFP List
efpListMetadata.setValue(tokenId, "user", abi.encodePacked(user));
```

By reading the `user` key for a given EFP List, a client can determine the User associated with that list.

```solidity
address user = abi.decode(efpListMetadata.getValue(tokenId, "user"), (address));
```

## Future

This pattern can be extended to support other list-specific metadata such as a name or description.

## Custom Keys

The format for custom keys are undefined at this time but will be defined in the future.
