title: List Storage Location
---

A **List Storage Location** defines where the list records and metadata are stored for an EFP List.

The List Storage Location value is stored in the main EFP List Registry contract and can be changed at any time by the EFP List NFT owner.

## Onchain Storage

All EFP data is stored on either Ethereum or a supported L2.

An EFP List can be uniquely specified via three pieces of data:
- `chain_id`: The 32-byte EVM chain ID of the chain where the list is stored.
- `contract_address`: The 20-byte EVM address of the contract where the list is stored.
- `nonce`: A 32-byte nonce that specifies the storage slot of the list within the contract. This disambiguates multiple lists stored within the same contract and de-couples it from the EFP List NFT token id which is stored on Ethereum and inaccessible on L2s.

The following chains are supported:
| Chain ID |  Name      | Layer      | Type              | 32-Byte Chain ID                                                     |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Ethereum   | L1         | Ethereum          | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` |

More chains will be announced prior to launch.

(\*) L2 proof systems for Optimistic Rollups are still under development.

## Serialization

List Storage Locations are encoded in a versioned, flexible data structure.

Each List Storage Location is encoded as a `bytes` array with the following structure:

- `version`: A `uint8` representing the version of the List Storage Location. This is used to ensure compatibility and facilitate future upgrades.
- `location_type`: A `uint8` indicating the type of list storage location. This serves as an identifier for the kind of data the data field contains.
- `data`: A `bytes` array containing the actual data of the list storage location. The structure of this data depends on the location type.

The version is always `1`.

The location type is always `1`.

Since only one location type is currently supported, the `data` field is always a `bytes` array of length `32 + 20 + 32 = 84`.

## Location Types

There is only one location type which covers both Ethereum and L2s.

| Location Type    | Description   | Data                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                | Reserved      | N/A                                                         |
| 1                | EVM contract  | 32-byte chain ID + 20-byte contract address + 32-byte nonce |
| 2 - 255          | Reserved      | N/A                                                         |

## Code

List Storage Location can be represented as a type in any programming language. Here are some examples:

#### Go

```go
type ListOp struct {
    Version uint8
    LocationType uint8
    Data []byte
}
```

#### Python

```python
class ListOp:
    version: int           # 0-255
    location_type: int     # 0-255
    data: bytes
```

#### Rust

```rust
struct ListOp {
    version: u8,
    location_type: u8,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

#### Solidity

```solidity
// the EFP contracts don't use this struct; they only store list
// storage locations as `bytes` with the version, location type,
// and data fields tightly packed into a single `bytes` value
// however, this struct can be useful for offchain processing with
// foundry or other Solidity tooling
struct ListOp {
    uint8 version;
    uint8 locationType;
    bytes data;
}
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
type ListOp = {
  version: number      // 0-255
  locationType: number // 0-255
  data: Uint8Array
}
```
