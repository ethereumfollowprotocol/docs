A **Tag** is a string associated with a List Record in an EFP list.

Tags only count for an account if that account is also followed by the user, otherwise they're not counted.

List Records can have zero or more tags. A few tags are standardized with specified semantics. Users may also set custom tags.

## Standard Tags

- **no tag**

  - If a List Record has no tags, it is interpreted as a simple follow without further categorization.

- **"block"**

  - This tag means neither the user nor the blocked account should see each other’s activity in a relevant app.
  - List Records with this tag are not included in Followers count, even if the List Record has other tags.
  - If both “block” and “mute” tags are present, “block” takes precedence.

- **"mute"**
  - This tag means the user shouldn't see the muted account’s activity in a relevant app, but the muted account might still be able to see the user’s activity.
  - List Records with this tag are not included in Followers count, even if the List Record has other tags.
  - If both “block” and “mute” tags are present, “block” takes precedence.

- **"top8"**
  - This tag means the account should appear in the user's "Top 8".
  - If a user has more than eight followed accounts with the "top8" tag, then only show the eight most recent should be included in a "Top 8" displayed in a UI.

## Custom Tags

Users can create additional arbitrary custom tags.

Any tag which violates these constraints is ignored.

### Constraints

A custom tag can be any UTF-8 string with the following constraints:

- maximum length of 255 bytes
- no leading or trailing whitespace
- more constraints to be added as needed

## Normalization

Tags are normalized by converting them to lowercase and removing leading and trailing whitespace.

Tags should be normalized before they are encoded into a List Op.

## Encoding

Tags are encoded as UTF-8 strings.

| Tag     | Encoding         |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| `block` | `62 6c 6f 63 6b` |
| `mute`  | `6d 75 74 65`    |
