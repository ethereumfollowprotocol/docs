title: Tags

A **Tag** is a string associated with a List Record in an EFP list. A List Record can have multiple tags.

A tag can be any UTF-8 string with the following constraints:
- maximum length of 255 bytes
- no leading or trailing whitespace
- more constraints to be added as needed

Any tag which violates these constraints is ignored.

## Normalization

Tags are normalized by converting them to lowercase and removing leading and trailing whitespace.

Tags should be normalized before they are encoded into a List Op.

## Encoding

Tags are encoded as UTF-8 strings.

| Tag              | Encoding         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `block`          | `62 6c 6f 63 6b` |
| `mute`           | `6d 75 74 65`    |
