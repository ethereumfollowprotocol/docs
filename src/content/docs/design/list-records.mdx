title: List Records
---

A **List Record** is a fundamental EFP data structure representing a record in an EFP List.

Each List Record consists of the following three components:

- `version`: A `uint8` representing the version of the List Record. This is used to ensure compatibility and facilitate future upgrades.
- `record_type`: A `uint8` indicating the type of record. This serves as an identifier for the kind of data the record holds.
- `data`: A `bytes` array containing the actual data of the record. The structure of this data depends on the record type.

The version is always `1`.

## Record Types

There is only one record type defined at this time:

| Type    | Description | Data            | Data Length |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 0       | Reserved    | N/A             | N/A         |
| 1       | Address     | 20-byte address | 20          |
| 2 - 255 | Reserved    | N/A             | N/A         |

Record types 0 and 2-255 are reserved for future use.

To illustrate the design, however, consider hypothetical list record types:

- a subscription to another EFP List, where the `data` field would contain the 32-byte token ID of the corresponding EFP NFT.
- an encrypted list record, where the `data` field would contain a list record encrypted with the public key of the list owner/manager/user (for privacy).
- an ERC-721 NFT token, where the `data` field would contain the 20-byte address of the ERC-721 contract, and the 32-byte token ID.
- an ERC-1155 token, where the `data` field would contain the 20-byte address of the ERC-1155 contract, the 32-byte token ID (exclude token amount).
- an ENS name, where the `data` field would contain the normalized string of the ENS name.
- a DNS name, where the `data` field would contain the normalized string of the DNS name.
- an IP address, where the `data` field would contain the IP address string.
- an email address, where the `data` field would contain the email address string.
- a torrent magnet link, where the `data` field would contain the magnet link string.
- a git repository URL, where the `data` field would contain the git remote URL string.
- an RSS feed, where the `data` field would contain the string URL of the RSS feed.
- an Atom feed, where the `data` field would contain the string URL of the Atom feed.
- a DID record, where the `data` field would contain the DID string.
- a custom record, where the `data` field would contain arbitrary or custom data.

Clients may support some or all of these record types depending on use case (once more than one record type is defined).

### Address Record (Type 1)

The following is an example of an encoded `ListRecord` of type 1 (address record):

| Byte(s) | Description                       | Value                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | `ListRecord` version (1 byte)     | `0x01`                                       |
| 1       | `ListRecord` record_type (1 byte) | `0x01`                                       |
| 2 - 21  | `ListRecord` data (20 bytes)      | `0x00000000000000000000000000000000DeaDBeef` |

## Validation

`version` should always be `1`.

`record_type` should always be `1` until other record types are defined.

`data` should always be exactly 20 bytes for record type `1`.

If any of the above conditions are not met, the `ListRecord` is considered invalid and should not be processed.

## Encoding

Onchain, list records are packed into byte arrays with the **version** and **record type** prepended to **data** to form an array with `2 + data.length` bytes.

```
+------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| version (1 byte) | recordType (1 byte) | data (variable length) |
+------------------+---------------------+------------------------+
```

This byte array will itself be a subarray of the list op data.

## Decoding

Managers have permissions to upload arbitrary list record data, so clients should be prepared to handle unexpected data.

When decoding a `ListRecord`, the `version` and `recordType` fields should be checked to ensure compatibility.

The length of the `data` field should be checked to ensure it is the expected length for the given `recordType`.

If the length of the `data` field is unexpected, the `ListRecord` should generally be ignored and not processed.

## Tags

A `Tag` is a string associated with a `ListRecord` in a list. A `ListRecord` can have multiple tags associated with it. A `Tag` is represented as a string.

### Normalization

Tags are normalized by converting them to lowercase and removing leading and trailing whitespace.

Tags should be normalized before they are encoded into a `ListOp`.

## Code

List Record can be represented as a type in any programming language. Here are some examples:

### Go

```go
type ListRecord struct {
    Version    uint8
    RecordType uint8
    Data       []byte
}
```

### Python

```python
class ListRecord:
    version: int        # 0-255
    record_type: int    # 0-255
    data: bytes
```

### Rust

```rust
struct ListRecord {
    version: u8,
    record_type: u8,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### Solidity

```solidity
/**
 * The EFP contracts don't use this struct; they only store list ops
 * as `bytes` and do not store list records directly. However, this
 * struct can be useful for offchain processing with foundry or other
 * Solidity tooling
 */
struct ListRecord {
    uint8 version;
    uint8 recordType;
    bytes data;
}
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
type ListRecord = {
  version: number // 0-255
  recordType: number // 0-255
  data: Uint8Array
}
```
